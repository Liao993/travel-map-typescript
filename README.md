# React Typescript Map Appplication
This Travel Map Pin Project was built with React & React-map-gl. I also used Redux Toolkit for the forntend state management.User is allowed to view and add their favorite spots on the map.For the backend server, I used express + mongodb to store my information. I implemented Joi for data validation across controller, service and database layers.
