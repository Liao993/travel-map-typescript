# This Travel Map Pin Project was built with React & React-map-gl, and I used Redux Toolkit for the forntend state management.
# User is allowed to view and add their favorite spots on the map.
# For the backend server, I used express+ mongodb to store my information. I implemented Joi for data validation across controller, service and database layers.
